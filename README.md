# Ingenious

**Ingenious** is a multi-agent accelerator designed to streamline the development and deployment of use cases for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides pre-built conversation patterns and agent services that can be customized and extended for various LLM-driven applications.

The core focus of this repository is the use of **conversation patterns** within the `multi_agent` architecture, allowing for rapid iteration and deployment of agents that support conversational tasks. **Detailed documentation** on how to configure, extend, and use the package will be provided through an online **MkDocs** site.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of setting up **Ingenious** on your system. The package is developed in Python and uses **FastAPI** for its API services.
