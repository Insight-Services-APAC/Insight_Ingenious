**Ingenious** is a multi-agent accelerator designed to streamline the development and deployment of use cases for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides pre-built conversation patterns and agent services that can be customized and extended for various LLM-driven applications.

The core focus of this repository is the use of **conversation patterns** within the `multi_agent` architecture, allowing for rapid iteration and deployment of agents that support conversational tasks.
