## Version 1.0.0 (2024-10-01)

### New Features:
- **Service Prefab with Efficient RAG (Retrieve and Generate) Memory Unit**:  
  Introduced a reusable service component designed to optimize memory handling for RAG-based workflows. This enables seamless retrieval of relevant context during multi-turn interactions, improving response accuracy and consistency across conversations.
  
- **Service Prefab with Group Chat Functionality**:  
  Implemented a service prefab that supports dynamic group chat interactions. This feature allows multiple agents to collaborate in real-time, with predefined rules for agent interaction, message routing, and topic classification, enhancing the scalability of multi-agent systems.

- **Updated Index Search Tool with Single Search Agent**:  
  Refined the index search functionality by consolidating multiple search mechanisms into a single `search_agent`. This improves performance and reduces complexity by streamlining the search process into a unified agent, responsible for handling all index-based queries efficiently.

### Documentation:
- **New Documentation Release**:  
  Comprehensive new documentation to guide users through the setup and integration of these new services. Detailed descriptions and step-by-step instructions are provided for integrating the service prefabs, memory management, and chat functionalities within your AI projects.

### Migration:
- **Ingenious Package Migration**:  
  Successfully migrated the `ingenious` package from [APAC-Capability-DAI-OpenAI-Collateral](https://github.com/Insight-Services-APAC/APAC-Capability-DAI-OpenAI-Collateral/tree/main/code_assets/3_api_ai_orchestration_layer). This migration consolidates orchestration logic, making the system more maintainable and modular, while supporting advanced orchestration features for multi-agent systems.
