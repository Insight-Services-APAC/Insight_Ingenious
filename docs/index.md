<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"Accelerating time-to-value for Generative AI Projects."</em></strong></p>

## Mission Statement

Welcome to the Insight Services APAC documentation, 
designed to guide you in developing and deploying Generative AI projects. Our goal is to provide a clear roadmap to accelerate your time-to-value, with a strong focus on business outcomes and production-ready architectures.

## Guiding Principles

1. **SaaS over PaaS** – We prioritize SaaS solutions to streamline and simplify Generative AI implementations.
2. **Selection Criteria for GenAI** – A strategic approach is taken when selecting the most suitable GenAI solutions.
3. **Business Value Focus** – Ensuring each project delivers tangible business value.
4. **Four-Tier Architecture for Production-Ready AI Projects:**
   - **Front End**: Integration with React and/or M365 (Teams).
   - **Middle Tier**: Python or .NET.
   - **GenAI Orchestrator**: Python-based.
   - **Data Tier**: Back end powered by Microsoft Fabric.
5. **Four-Tier Architecture for POCs:**
   - **Front End**: React or similar frameworks.
   - **Middle Tier**: Python with FastAPI.
   - **AI Orchestrator**: Python, leveraging SmartSpace.Ai Workflow SDK.
   - **Data Tier**: Fabric as the back end.
6. **Landing Zone Deployments**: Using Bicep or Terraform for automated deployments.
