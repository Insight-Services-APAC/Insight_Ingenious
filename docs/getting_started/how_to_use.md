## Your First Conversation

**Navigate to the `Insight_Ingenious` root folder**:
   After the package installation, the first step is to navigate to the `Insight_Ingenious` root directory. This folder contains all the necessary files required to run the conversation test script. By moving to this folder, you ensure that you're in the correct environment where the test files are located.

   Use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

   This will move you one level up from your current directory into the `Insight_Ingenious` folder, assuming it's located in the parent directory.


**Run the first test conversation**:
   Now that you're in the root directory, you can proceed to run the test script. This script will simulate a conversation and check if the memory and conversation pattern are working correctly. The test showcases how agents interact, share information, and call necessary functions for tasks like retrieving data or responding to queries.

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 ./conversation_pattern_example/test_multitool.py
   ```

   If the test runs successfully, you will see a detailed conversation output like the one shown below:

## Insights

  
- **Classification**: The conversation is classified as a 'general' query and flagged as "AMBIGUOUS-contact number." This ambiguity prompts the search agent to query different indexes (`vector-health` and `vector-safety`) to find relevant information.

- **Suggested Tool Calls**: The output shows two suggestions for tool calls to the `search_tool`, each targeting a specific index to find relevant details about the contact numbers.

- **Async Function Execution**: The conversation flow shows asynchronous function calls for `search_tool`, which loads necessary configurations and profiles before executing the search.

- **Search Results**: Two search results are returned, each providing detailed information such as emergency contact numbers and procedures for dealing with emergencies.

- **Response Generation**: The `search_agent` generates a response based on the search results, ensuring that the contact number is prominently displayed throughout the site for all personnel.

- **Memory Recording**: The script then records the conversation in memory for future reference, capturing both the userâ€™s question and the corresponding response.

- **Error Handling**: In the sample, an error occurs due to a missing `reporter` function, prompting the `researcher` agent to summarize the conversation manually.
