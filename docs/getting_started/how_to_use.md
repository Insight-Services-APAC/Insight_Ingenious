## Your first conversation

1.  After package installation, navigate to the `Insight_Ingenious` root folder**:
    In this step, you will move to the root directory of the `Insight_Ingenious` project. This is essential to ensure that you are in the correct folder that contains the necessary files and subdirectories required for running tests or performing other operations.

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

    This will take you out of your current working directory into the `Insight_Ingenious` folder, which is assumed to be the parent directory of where you are currently located.

2. **Run the first test conversation**:
    Now that you are in the root folder of `Insight_Ingenious`, you can run the test script that checks the improved memory functionality of the conversation pattern.

    ```bash
    python3 ./conversation_pattern_example/test_improved_memory.py
    ```

    Make sure that all dependencies are installed, and any required configuration files or environment variables are properly set before running the script. If successful, the test results will provide feedback on whether the conversation memory enhancements are functioning as expected.
