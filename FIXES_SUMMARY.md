# Ingenious Framework - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chat Memory Not Working Within Threads ✅

**Problem**: Agents weren't using previous conversation context even when thread_id was provided.

**Root Cause**: The main service was hardcoding `chat_request.thread_memory = "no existing context."` regardless of whether thread messages were retrieved.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Modified `/ingenious/services/chat_services/multi_agent/service.py`** (lines 71-78):
   - Now properly builds thread memory from retrieved messages
   - Uses last 10 messages for context
   - Only sets "no existing context" when there are no thread messages

2. **Enhanced system prompts** in SQL manipulation and knowledge base agents:
   - Added explicit instructions to reference previous conversation
   - Added guidance for handling follow-up questions
   - Added support for contextual references like "it", "that", "those"

### 2. Token Counting Returns 0 for Classification Agent ✅

**Problem**: The classification-agent always returned token_count: 0 and max_token_count: 0.

**Root Causes**:
1. LLMUsageTracker wasn't added to logger handlers in classification agent
2. The emit method in LLMUsageTracker expected an Agents object but received a list

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Modified `/ingenious/services/chat_services/multi_agent/conversation_flows/classification_agent/classification_agent.py`** (lines 43-51):
   - Changed agents parameter from empty list to `["classification_agent"]`
   - Added `logger.handlers = [llm_logger]` to register the handler

2. **Modified `/ingenious/models/agent.py`** (lines 377-445):
   - Added graceful handling when `_agents` is a list instead of Agents object
   - Token counting now works regardless of agent availability
   - Agent-specific updates only happen when agent is available

### 3. Azure AI Search Integration - No Data Indexed ✅

**Solution**: Created a script to populate Azure AI Search with dummy data.

**Created**: `/ingenious/scripts/populate_azure_search.py`
- Automatically creates the search index with proper schema
- Uploads 8 sample documents covering all categories mentioned in the knowledge base agent
- Verifies successful upload
- Uses environment variables from .env for configuration

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Chat Memory
```bash
# Start a conversation with a specific thread_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_prompt": "What columns are in the database?",
    "thread_id": "test-thread-123",
    "conversation_flow": "sql-manipulation-agent"
  }'

# Follow up with the same thread_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_prompt": "Show me the first 5 rows of that table",
    "thread_id": "test-thread-123",
    "conversation_flow": "sql-manipulation-agent"
  }'
```

### 2. Test Token Counting
```bash
# Make a request to classification agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_prompt": "Tell me about workplace safety",
    "conversation_flow": "classification-agent"
  }'

# Check the response - it should now include non-zero token counts
```

### 3. Test Azure AI Search
```bash
# First, populate Azure AI Search with dummy data
uv run python scripts/populate_azure_search.py

# Then test the knowledge base agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_prompt": "Tell me about workplace safety guidelines",
    "conversation_flow": "knowledge-base-agent"
  }'
```

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Thread memory is now properly retrieved and formatted
- ✅ Agents have enhanced prompts to use conversation context
- ✅ Token counting works for all agents including classification
- ✅ Azure AI Search can be populated with test data

The framework should now properly maintain conversation context within threads and accurately track token usage across all agents.
